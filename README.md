# ECG Info Lock Interface

A secure authentication system that uses your unique ECG biometric signature to protect and unlock sensitive information.



## 🔐 Project Overview

ECG Info Lock is a biometric-based security application that leverages the uniqueness of each user's ECG signal as a key for unlocking protected information. The system combines a Flutter-based frontend with a machine learning model trained to recognize and verify ECG signatures.
